- 👋 Hi, I’m Kouyu Yang, a person who is enthusiastic about exploring data and generating actionable insights.
- 💼 I have over 4 years of working experience as a Hotel Revenue Analyst and more than 1 year of working experience as a Business Analyst.
- 💞️ I am currently seeking a full career transformation into a data-related role.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Machine Learning! 
- 🌱 I'm currently honing my skills in DAX, Python, and libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a very cute dog and she is the social queen who is really good at making friends, so everyone at my home learns from her!
